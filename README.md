# Predicting the overall star rating for a business

* Review Count: Utilize the review_count column, assuming that businesses with better service quality tend to accumulate more reviews.

* Sentiment Analysis:
- Leverage the text column from the review table to perform sentiment analysis.
- Test whether the presence of sentiment-laden words like "hate" and "love" can act as predictors of overall rating.

* Validation with Stars Column:

- Validate and refine hypotheses using the stars column from the business table.
- Verify whether the assumptions about review count and sentiment align with the actual star ratings.
